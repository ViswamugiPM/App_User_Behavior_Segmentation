📱 App User Behavior Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale app user behavior data to segment users based on engagement and activity patterns. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify meaningful user groups and translate these insights into actionable business strategies such as targeted marketing, retention planning, and product optimization.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains 50,000 user records with features related to:

User demographics (age, gender, country)

Device and app usage details

Session behavior and engagement metrics

Churn risk indicators and user activity patterns

🔍 Project Workflow

Data Collection
Loaded raw app user behavior data from CSV format.

Data Understanding
Analyzed data structure, feature types, value ranges, and missing values using descriptive statistics.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (median imputation for numerical features).

Ensured consistency in data types.

Removed invalid or inconsistent entries.

Feature Selection & Engineering
Selected relevant behavioral features influencing user engagement and activity.

Data Scaling & Normalization
Applied StandardScaler to normalize features before clustering.

Clustering Model Selection
Implemented K-Means clustering to group users based on behavioral similarity.

Optimal Cluster Identification
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Assignment
Assigned cluster labels to each user and stored the results for analysis.

Cluster Profiling & Interpretation
Analyzed cluster-wise engagement, activity, and churn risk to understand user behavior patterns.

Business Insight Generation & Customer Action Mapping
Translated clusters into actionable business strategies for marketing, retention, and personalization.
